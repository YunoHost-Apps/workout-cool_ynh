# Packaging an app, starting from this example

- (Alternatively to this small tutorial, consider checking out <https://appgenerator.yunohost.org> !)
- Copy this app before working on it, using the ['Use this template'](https://github.com/new?template_name=example_ynh&template_owner=YunoHost) button on the Github repo
- Edit the `manifest.toml` with app specific info
- Edit the `install`, `upgrade`, `remove`, `backup` and `restore` scripts, and any relevant conf files in `conf/`
  - Using the [script helpers documentation](https://yunohost.org/packaging_apps_helpers)
- Edit the `change_url` and `config` scripts too, or remove them if you have no use of them
- Add a `LICENSE` file for the package.
  - NB: this `LICENSE` file is not meant to necessarily be the same LICENSE as the upstream app - it is only the LICENSE you want this package's code to published with and you can choose it freely! (If you don't know which to choose, we recommend [the AGPL-3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt))
- Edit files under the `doc/` directory ([see the page about documenting packages](https://yunohost.org/packaging_app_doc))
- The `README.md` files are to be automatically generated by <https://github.com/YunoHost/apps_tools/blob/main/readme_generator>

Explain in *a few (10~15) words* the purpose of the app or what it actually does (it is meant to give a rough idea to users browsing a catalog of 100+ apps)
